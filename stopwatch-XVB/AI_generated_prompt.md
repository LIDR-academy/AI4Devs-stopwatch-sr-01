# 🕒 Stopwatch Web Application

We want to build a responsive web application that supports two main features: a **stopwatch** and a **countdown timer**, with the ability to manage **multiple instances simultaneously**.

## 👨‍💻 Role

You are a **highly skilled web developer**, expert in:

- **SOLID principles**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Design Patterns**
- **TypeScript development**
- Building maintainable, modular, and scalable front-end architectures

## 📄 Requirements

1. **File Separation**:

2. Use **TypeScript**
3. Use JS Vanilla
3. Apply **SOLID principles** consistently
4. Follow **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD) where applicable (e.g., model timers as domain entities)
5. Implement **console logs** for key lifecycle events:

   - Pause
   - Reset
   - Countdown finished
6. Implement **exception handling** to catch potential runtime errors
7. Use `/res/stopwatch.png` as **inspiration for the UI design**
8. Ensure the website is **responsive**, adapting well to both desktop and mobile screens

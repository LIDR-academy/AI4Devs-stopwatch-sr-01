Chatbot.

I use the model Claude-4-sonnet Max inside cursor and this directly generate the folder and generate the files in that folder.
we load the images that was generated also in taking the screenshots when the app is running. 

Issues find it.

The initial generation was so slow and get some garbage in the generation of the html. i had to remove some parts in the code generated cause was garbage.

Decitions take like developer.

Inclusions of files to resolve in a best way the task.

How to value this exercise.

Well i guess this help me more to check about how to improve my skills to write correctly prompts that help to decrease the time in dev and improve the productivity.

   ```
   
   **Option C: PHP Built-in Server**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Enjoy!** Start timing your activities and challenges! 🏔️

### Alternative: Direct File Access
You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser, but some features may be limited due to CORS restrictions.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Implementation

### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- `TimeKeeper`: Base time management functionality
- `Stopwatch`: Counting up logic
- `Timer`: Countdown logic with completion handling
- `NavigationManager`: Page transitions and routing
- `SoundManager`: Audio playback functionality
- `App`: Application coordination and event handling

#### **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Easy to extend with new timer types by extending `TimeKeeper`
- New page types can be added to `NavigationManager`
- Sound effects can be extended in `SoundManager`

#### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- `Stopwatch` and `Timer` can be used interchangeably where `TimeKeeper` is expected
- Both implement the required `tick()` method with their specific behavior

#### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Classes only depend on methods they actually use
- `SoundManager` provides only audio-related functionality
- `NavigationManager` handles only navigation concerns

#### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- `App` class depends on abstractions (base classes) rather than concrete implementations
- Timer completion callback is injected as dependency

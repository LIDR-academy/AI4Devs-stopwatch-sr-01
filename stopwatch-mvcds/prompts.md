# Prompt Inicial

I've used metaprompt because I want to train this practice, i've tried to give it all the requirements and be explicit about how i wanted the files to look like

# Role

You're a prompt engineer specialist that wants to create a prompt in markdown for creating a a webapp using vanilla javascript

# Context

The app should have separated files for html, styling, and script

Use the best practices of prompt engineering to yield the best practices of programming

# Task

The app should allow a user to create and manage multiple stopwatches s and timers at the same time

When a timer is finished, it should show a notification and play an alert sound

---

Fell free to ask me any claryfing questions about how the app should look like and behave

And produce the prompt in markdown

# Resultados Parciales

- The initial markdown didn't generate code
- WHen it generatd code, it was on the template folder instead of mine
- First versio of the code didn't have neither stopwathces/timers working, just adding and removing them
- Second version lacked laps and notifications
- Third was filling the basic requirements
- Fourth had UI improvements

# Refinamentos Aplicaods

- Le pedi un par de cosas que no estavan functionando bien a principio

# Prompt Final

for stopwatches: lap can only be available once it is running

for timers: remove the set button, the user has to manually start it, hide the test button

## Explicacion

Last prompt was very specific and built on base of existing code, i was just adjusting functionality

# Chatbots

ChatGPT (4o), Cursor (auto), Copilot (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

# Problemas

- Even asking ChatGPT for Markdown, it didn't do it initially
- Asking all at once made Cursor take a looong time
- Neither timer nor stopwatch worked on the beginning, tho it told me it would be the next steps
- Cursor stopped working, went to copilot
- I had to tell it to fix the lap
- Code is big and in a single file, no testsing

# Decisiones

- I had to add a button to test the timmer so i wouldn't have to wait
- UI/UX choices

# Evaluacion

- Esta bien para hacer lo basico
- I lacked going deeper with requirement analysis or other stuff that not strictly coding

# üïí Stopwatch Web Application

We want to build a responsive web application that supports two main features: a **stopwatch** and a **countdown timer**, with the ability to manage **multiple instances simultaneously**.

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Role

You are a **highly skilled web developer**, expert in:

- **SOLID principles**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Design Patterns**
- **TypeScript development**
- Building maintainable, modular, and scalable front-end architectures

---

## üìÑ Requirements

1. **File Separation**:
   - `index.html` for the markup
   - `script.ts` for the logic (compiled to `script.js`)
2. Use **TypeScript**
3. Use JS Vanilla
3. Apply **SOLID principles** consistently
4. Follow **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD) where applicable (e.g., model timers as domain entities)
5. Implement **console logs** for key lifecycle events:
   - Start
   - Pause
   - Reset
   - Countdown finished
6. Implement **exception handling** to catch potential runtime errors
7. Use `/res/stopwatch.png` as **inspiration for the UI design**
8. Ensure the website is **responsive**, adapting well to both desktop and mobile screens

---

## ‚úÖ Functional Criteria

1. When a **countdown reaches zero**:
   - Show a **browser notification**
   - Play a **sound alert**
2. Allow users to:
   - **Create, manage, and delete** multiple **stopwatches and countdown timers**
   - Run them **simultaneously** and **independently**

---

## üí° Additional Suggestions (Optional but Recommended)

- Handle **notification permissions** gracefully (request from user if not already granted)
- Define basic **UI components** (e.g., buttons, cards, modals)
- Specify if **vanilla TypeScript** is required or a framework like **React/Vue** is acceptable
- Clarify if the **alert sound** should be custom (e.g., `/res/alert.mp3`) or a system default

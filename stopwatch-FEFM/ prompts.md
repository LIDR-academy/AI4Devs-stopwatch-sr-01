1: Hey Cursor, imagine you are the best developer and you need to develop a stopwatch implementing the frontend and functionality... please use @index.html to generate the interface and @script.js to generate all the functions of the stopwatch

Keep in mind this things
1.- When a countdown ends, it displays a notification and plays an alert sound. 2. It offers the ability to create and manage multiple stopwatch or countdowns simultaneously.
3.- Do the best effort to developt the interface like @stopwatch.png

2: for some reason, the notifications isnâ€™t allowed by the brower... I would like to change it for "alert()" function
